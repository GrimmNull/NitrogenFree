Have you had enough of Discord's ```bugs```, ```free nitro bots``` 
and ```✨Greed✨```?

Maybe it's the time for you to *FREE YOURSELF FROM THE NITRO OVERLORDS AND BECOME ✨NITROGEN FREE✨*

NitrogenFree is a chat app made with ReactJs, Typescript, NodeJs, WebSockets and WebRTC (soon)

On a more serious note, the project is a cool little app I'm trying to create, 
so I can learn some new things along the way.
It's not going to be the next big chatting app, just a passion project :D
