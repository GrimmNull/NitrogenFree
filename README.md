Have you had enough of Discord's ```bugs```, ```free nitro bots``` 
and ```✨Greed✨```?

Maybe it's the time for you to *FREE YOURSELF FROM THE NITRO OVERLORDS AND BECOME ✨NITROGEN FREE✨*

NitrogenFree is a chat app made with ReactJs, Typescript (implemented finally), NodeJs, WebSockets and WebRTC (soon™)

On a more serious note, the project is a cool little app I'm trying to create, 
so I can learn some new things along the way.
It's not going to be the next big chatting app, just a passion project :D


# How to run

1) Open the ./server folder and run ```npm install```
2) Run the server with ```nodemon``` or ```node index.js```
3) Open the ./client-react folder and fill the ```.env``` file by following ```.env.example```
4) Run or build the webapp by using ```npm run start```/```npm run build```

###Extra steps for the native app:
